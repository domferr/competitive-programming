# Towers

Little Vasya has received a young builderâ€™s kit. The kit consists of several wooden bars, the lengths of all of them
are known. The bars can be put one on the top of the other if their lengths are the same. Vasya wants to construct the
minimal number of towers from the bars. Help Vasya to use the bars in the best way possible. Problem available
