# Competitive Programming and Contests

Each problem comes with a solution written in C++ and its test suite. Testing is done by using the [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) framework.

## Problems

#### Trapping Rain Water | [Solution](https://github.com/domferr/competitive-programming/tree/main/TrappingRainWater)
  
Given an array arr[] of N non-negative integers representing the height of blocks. If width of each block is 1, compute how much water can be trapped between the blocks during the rainy season. Problem available also on [GeeksForGeeks](http://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/trapping-rain-water/0).

#### Sliding Window Maximum | [Solution](https://github.com/domferr/competitive-programming/tree/main/SlidingWindowMaximum)

Given an array arr[] of N elements and integer K, find the maximum for each and every contiguous subarray (window) of size K. Problem available also on [GeeksForGeeks](http://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/maximum-of-all-subarrays-of-size-k/0).

#### Next Larger Element | [Solution](https://github.com/domferr/competitive-programming/tree/main/NextLargerElement)

Given an array arr[] of size N having distinct elements, the task is to find the next greater element for each element of the array in order of their appearance in the array. Next greater element of an element in the array is the nearest element on the right which is greater than the current element. If there does not exist next greater of current element, then next greater element for current element is -1. For example, next greater of the last element is always -1. Problem available also on [GeeksForGeeks](http://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/next-larger-element-1587115620/1).

#### Max Segment Intersections | [Solution](https://github.com/domferr/competitive-programming/tree/main/MaxSegmentIntersections)

Given an array arr[] consisting of N pairs of type {L, R}, each representing a segment on the X-axis, the task is to find the maximum number of intersections a segment has with other segments. Problem available also on [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-number-of-intersections-possible-for-any-of-the-n-given-segments/).

#### Longest K Good Segment | [Solution](https://github.com/domferr/competitive-programming/tree/main/LongestKGoodSegment)

The array a with n integers is given. Let's call the sequence of one or more consecutive elements in a segment. Also let's call the segment k-good if it contains no more than k different values. Find any longest k-good segment. Problem available also on [CodeForces](https://codeforces.com/contest/616/problem/D?locale=en).

#### Nested Segments | [Solution](https://github.com/domferr/competitive-programming/tree/main/NestedSegments)

You are given n segments on a line. There are no ends of some segments that coincide. For each segment find the number of segments it contains.
