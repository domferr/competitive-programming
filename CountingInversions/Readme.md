# Counting Inversions

Given an array, compute the number of inversions. Inversions for an array indicates â€“ how far (or close) the array is 
from being sorted. If the array is already sorted, then the inversion count is 0, but if the array is sorted in 
the reverse order, the inversion count is the maximum. Formally speaking, two elements a[i] and a[j] form an inversion 
if a[i] > a[j] and i < j. Problem available also on [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/counting-inversions/).
